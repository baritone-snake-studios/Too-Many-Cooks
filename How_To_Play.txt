Hi, there! We didn't have enough time to create an
installer for this, so you'll need to run it yourself :)

In a day or two, we will post a link to a full, no-effort, installer
on our github, at:
https://github.com/baritone-snake-studios/Too-Many-Cooks

...But if that hasn't happened yet...

You'll need python3.4
https://www.python.org/downloads/
(Click the yellow button that says 'Download Python 3.4.2')

You'll need pygame. If you're on windows, you can get it:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

(If your PC is 64-bit, look at the amd64 links, otherwise win32 ,
then download the one that ends with "-py3.4.exe"


Double click game.bat
(or run the game.py file yourself)

We do apologize for the hassle,
  :D
