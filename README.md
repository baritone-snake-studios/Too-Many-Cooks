##### LudumDare31 Jam Entry

Written in Python3.4 with PyGame. PyxelEdit was used for art.

###Controls:

Arrows Keys, Space-Bar and 1,2,3,4 keys when a menu appears.

There's no real "end" or win/lose scenario, the last level will continue for ever. Sorry, time, man.

If you're on some other OS (or want to run the game straight from the python source), here are the instructions:

Lite Instructions:

* This should work with Python2/3.
* You'll need the correct version of pygame installed for your system/python version.

Detailed Instructions: 

* You'll need python3.4
* https://www.python.org/downloads/
* (Click the yellow button that says 'Download Python 3.4.2')

* You'll need pygame. If you're on windows, you can get it:
* http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

* (If your PC is 64-bit, look at the amd64 links, otherwise win32 ,
* then download the one that ends with "-py3.4.exe"

* Double click game.bat (or run "python game.py")
